          <br>This site was made for a website design <br>
          program, and well you can’t make any <br>
          valid purchases. If you are looking for<br>
           animals or products we recommend <br>
           checking out <a href="https://www.mcmurrayhatchery.com/index.html">Mc Murrayhatchery</a> a true <br>
           hatchery located here in Canada. <br>
           There are also many other farm websites,<br>
           but you must keep an eye out for the fakes. </p>

  Hello welcome to Sunnyside Up Farms, here we have many products all related to farm life. 
  We specialize in eggs as our name would suggest, but we also have many other things. 
  If you are thinking of starting a farm we recommend looking at our “Products” page. 
  Similarly if you are looking for animal care items like incubators and feed, we recommend 
  looking at our “Food” page. When you’re here don’t forget to stop by our forms to fill out 
  a few questions. And keep an eye out for the hidden easter egg.
