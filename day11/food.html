            For the first 18 set the humidity to 40-50 percent, for the final days of hatching you must turn it up to 65-75 percent or the chicks won’t hatch. The normal temperature for an incubator is 99f-100f if the temperature goes above or below that mark the chicks won’t hatch so be careful and keep a close eye on it over the course of the hatching period. After the first week go into a dark room and candle the egg, or put a strong light under the egg (like a flashlight, or phone) if 
you see veins the egg is fertile and might hatch, if not it won’t.

        <p>This is a link to “White House On The Hill’ I got a lot of inspiration from them. They are located in Greenvine Texas and have many different types of animals. Ranging from over 70 chickens to Emus, and recently cows. They used to live at a rented site in the country but have recently moved out to their own farmstead. As their name would suggest, they live in a white house on a hill. Their videos are about their journey on their homestead, and are always upbeat and fun.  They show many different ways that they need to take care of their animals, and what it really takes to run a farm. Jake the husband is always filming their adventures and showing off cool contraptions like an auto closing chicken door, or a homemade lego beehive. If you are looking into going into homesteading I recommend checking out their channel because they will 
          give you a look into farming and all the work it takes to take care of animals, vegetables, fruit and a big family.</p>
