<p id="text2">Here are some of the things you’ll need if you want to start your very own farm, 
  namely one to take care of chickens. Check out our Incubators and heat lamps for young 
  chicks, or use our feed and grain to grow them.

        <p>
          For the first 18 set the humidity to 40-50 percent, for the final days of 
          hatching you must turn it up to 65-75 percent or the chicks won’t hatch. 
          The normal temperature for an incubator is 99f-100f if the temperature goes 
          above or below that mark the chicks won’t hatch so be careful and keep a close
           eye on it over the course of the hatching period. After the first week go into a 
           dark room and candle the egg, or put a strong light under the egg 
           (like a flashlight, or phone) if 
          you see veins the egg is fertile and might hatch, if not it won’t.

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are our incubators and heat lamps, make sure that they aren’t too hot for chickens. 
          Also remember to spray or add humidity to your incubator. Don’t worry with this brand you don’t have to worry about turning/rotating 
          the eggs. Heat lamps are used for young chicks, 
          and incubators are used for the eggs. Eggs take 21 days on average to hatch so don’t expect anything right away. </p>
